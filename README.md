"Decoding the intricacies of AI-tech in Venture Capital through a Machine Learning lens."
"Why a Machine Learner in a VC team?" you might ask. Who better to comprehend and apply AI's fundamentals in VC than someone with a deep-rooted understanding of machine learning? Especially, in this era of LLMs.
